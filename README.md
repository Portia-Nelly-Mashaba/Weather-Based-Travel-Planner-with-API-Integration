# Weather-Based Travel Planner with API Integration

## Project Description
The Weather-Based Travel Planner is a web application that helps users plan trips based on real-time weather conditions. Users can search for destinations, view current weather data and a 7-day forecast, and get activity recommendations tailored to the weather. Additionally, users can save favorite destinations for quick access and view their locations on a map.

## Features
### Core Features
1. **Destination Search**:
   - Search for a destination by city or location name.
2. **Weather Integration**:
   - Fetch current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast using the integrated Weather API.
   - Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall weather conditions.
3. **Activity Recommendations**:
   - Suggest activities based on weather conditions (e.g., hiking for sunny weather, indoor activities for rain).
4. **Favorites List**:
   - Save and manage a list of favorite destinations for quick reference.

### Bonus Feature
- **Map Integration**:
   - Display the selected destination on an interactive map using a Map API.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: CSS for responsive and user-friendly UI

### Backend
- **Server**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for user authentication and data storage
- **APIs**:
  - Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack) for weather data
  - Map API (e.g., Google Maps or Mapbox) for location visualization

### Collaboration
- **Version Control**: GitHub for code management
- **Task Management**: Trello for organizing project tasks

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or above)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase account for backend setup
- API keys for Weather and Map APIs

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd weather-travel-planner
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
     ```env
     REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=<your_weather_api_key>
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your_firebase_api_key>
     REACT_APP_MAP_API_KEY=<your_map_api_key>
     ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend Setup
1. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
2. Configure Firebase:
   - Add Firebase credentials in `firebaseConfig.js`.
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

## APIs Used
1. **Weather API**: Fetches real-time and forecast weather data.
2. **Firebase API**: Handles user authentication and data storage.
3. **Map API**: Displays destination locations on a map.

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **API Rate Limits**:
   - Optimized API requests by caching results for frequently searched destinations.
2. **Weather-Based Activity Suggestions**:
   - Created a predefined dataset to map weather conditions to activities for faster lookups.
3. **Cross-Origin Issues**:
   - Configured CORS middleware on the backend server.

## Project Deliverables
- [Live App Link](#)
- [GitHub Repository](#)
- APK Link (if applicable)

## Future Improvements
- Add multi-language support.
- Enhance UI/UX with animations and interactive elements.
- Include user reviews for activity suggestions.
